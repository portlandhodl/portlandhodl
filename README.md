### ABOUT ME
Non-toxic Bitcoin Maximalist since 2013, Founder of QR Snap, llc a QR Code redirection service with an emphasis on analytics. 

### Nyans Keys - Project Icarus 
Developed an FPGA based parallel keyboard subinterface allowing each key to be indexed in parallel. In addition to a high degree of flexibility
using an FPGA has allowed for sub milisecond latency with low debounce time switches. The user can use lower performance switches such as Cherry MX Blues (5ms debounce) and will be able to acheive the lowest possible latency with those switches.

Nyan Keys has 3 Primary Components
 - [FGPA Bitstream](https://github.com/russeree/nyan-keys-ice40hx4k-bitstream)
 - [STM32 Firmware](https://github.com/russeree/nyan-keys-stm32-firmware)
 - PCB Schematic and Layout

The performance of Nyan Keys when configured with Cherry MX2A ([sub 1ms bounce time](https://www.cherry-world.com/company/press/article/cherry-mx2a-exceeding-expectations)) can exceed that of the Wooting with true sub 1ms latency.
