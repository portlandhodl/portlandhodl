### Nyan Keys
An FPGA based mechanical keyboard designed for the lowest possible latency and programmability. The FPGA parallel subinterface allowing each key to be indexed in parallel. In addition to a high degree of flexibility
using an FPGA has allowed for sub milisecond latency with low debounce time switches. Lower performance switches such as Cherry MX Blues (5ms debounce) can be used and still acheive the lowest possible latency for that switch.

Nyan Keys has 4 Primary Components
 - [FGPA Bitstream](https://github.com/russeree/nyan-keys-ice40hx4k-bitstream)
 - [STM32 Firmware](https://github.com/russeree/nyan-keys-stm32-firmware)
 - [Web Serial API GUI](https://github.com/russeree/nyan-keys-gui) - WIP
 - [PCB Schematic and Layout](https://github.com/russeree/nyan-keys-hardware)

The performance of Nyan Keys when configured with Cherry MX2A ([sub 1ms bounce time](https://www.cherry-world.com/company/press/article/cherry-mx2a-exceeding-expectations)) can exceed that of the Wooting with true sub 1ms latency.
